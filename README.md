- 👋 Hi, I’m @San3-Cod3

- 👀 I’m interested in ... making simple stuff, noob friendly code - dumbing it down.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... to make scripts and bots, be they Windows Batch / executable stuff, Linux shell stuff, eggdrop TCL scripts or Python bots.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... eggdrop TCL scripts and Python bots for now.
